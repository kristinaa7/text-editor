# Text Editor

## Description 
In this week's challenge, I built a text editor that runs in the browser and also has the functionality to work while offline. The application meets the Progressive Web Application (PWA criteria)

## Installation 
To install the application, you will need to run a npm install for all the necessary packages in the terminal:

``npm install``
